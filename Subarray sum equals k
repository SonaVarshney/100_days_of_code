O(N2)=
generate all subarrays and then maintain a count that counts all subarrays with k sum

two nested loops

as 10^4 constraint optimally use O(N)

whenever you have to find min subarray  ya max length subarray then use sliding window
but isme nahi

here two pointer also not use because we don't have to just find a pair;


we'll use prefix sum

a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i 
----x----
---------y-----------

if(y-x)=k then return the subtracted subarray


we'll use hashmap

1) sum=0
2) iterate
3) if(sum==k) count++
4) add sum to map 
and check sum-k is in hashmap then again count++
